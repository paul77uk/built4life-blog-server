Still only managed 1 sandbag clean & press
But 10 min emom singles of sandbag clean & press.

Did each side straight after the other for 10 reps each side shoulder carries.
Then did 2 minutes on the minute, doing each side within the 2 minutes, for 8 metres each.
I just did 3 rounds, will increase overtime, but may have to change things when my carries get longer.

Maybe that will do for today, don't want to push it too much, I know not much but it will increase overtime.
