I'm thinking of doing a full body everyday workout if I can, 3 days a week.
Thinking of the 5x5 program, and Wendler Programs, and even Dan Johns ABC.
You usually have a push, pull and hinge movement, Dab John's ABc, has clean, press and squat, but also mentions about farmers or a carry.
I thinking of some kind of clean and shouldering would come into that.
A push, overhead press or a floor press.
A Carry, whether bearhug, or shoulder carry.
And a squat.
I think a may do clean and presses, shouldering, shoulder carries, bearhug carries, and squats in my routine.
Maybe occurred to me, I could do all these in one workout, 3 days a week.
